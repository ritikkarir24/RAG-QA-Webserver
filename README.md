# RAG QA System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) web server for question answering over your own PDF documents. Built with FastAPI, LangChain, and Ollama, this project enables users to upload documents, process them into vector databases, and interactively query their content using advanced LLMs.


## High-Level Architecture

```
User (Browser)
   |
   |  (HTTP/REST, SSE)
   v
FastAPI Backend (main.py)
   |
   |-- Document Service (background processing, chunking, embedding, vector DB)
   |-- Query Service (retrieval, streaming answers)
   |-- Log Service (in-memory logs for UI)
   |
   |-- File System (temp/, saved_dbs/, processing_status/)
   |
   |-- LangChain + Ollama (deepseek-r1:14b for embeddings & LLM)
   v
Vector DB (FAISS), BM25, Hybrid Retriever
```

## üöÄ Features
- **Document Upload**: Supports PDF and HTML files for ingestion.
- **Automated Chunking & Embedding**: Documents are split and embedded using the DeepSeek LLM via Ollama.
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines semantic (vector) and keyword (BM25) search for robust QA.
- **Streaming Answers**: Real-time, word-by-word answer streaming to the UI.
- **Multiple Search Modes**: Switch between hybrid, semantic, and keyword retrieval.
- **Persistent Vector DBs**: Save and reload processed document databases.
- **Server Logs**: Live server log panel for transparency and debugging.

## ‚ú® Additional Features
- Processing status polling and user feedback during document ingestion
- Cancel upload and cancel answer actions in the UI
- Modular service-based backend (document, query, log services)
- In-memory and persistent logging for transparency
- Support for multiple saved databases and easy switching
- Error handling and user-friendly status messages

## üöÄ Scalability & Extensibility
- **Backend**: Built on FastAPI and LangChain, enabling easy extension to new file types, retrieval strategies, or LLMs.
- **Vector DB**: Uses FAISS for scalable vector search; can be swapped for distributed or cloud-based vector stores.
- **Retrieval**: Modular retriever design allows plugging in new algorithms or hybrid strategies.
- **UI**: Jinja2 templating and REST API make it easy to build richer frontends or integrate with other systems.
- **Deployment**: Can be containerized and deployed on cloud platforms with GPU/CPU scaling as needed.
- **Multi-user**: Architecture supports extension to multi-user, multi-session, or authentication-enabled deployments.

## üìù Usage
- **Upload** a PDF or HTML file using the web interface.
- Wait for processing to complete (progress and status are shown).
- **Ask questions** about the document content in natural language.
- Switch retrieval modes as needed for best results.
- View logs and manage saved databases from the UI.

## üß© Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, BM25, Ollama, PyMuPDF
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS (Jinja2 templates)
- **LLM**: DeepSeek via Ollama (local inference)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Notes
- **UI/UX**: The user interface is intentionally minimal and functional. Due to time constraints, the focus was on backend robustness and retrieval quality rather than UI polish. PRs for UI improvements are welcome!
- **Model Requirements**: Requires Ollama and the DeepSeek model running locally.
- **File Types**: Only PDF supported.
